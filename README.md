# Retail Store Inventory Forecasting - EDA

## Project Overview
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** for retail store inventory forecasting. The goal is to analyze sales, orders, and inventory levels to understand trends, detect anomalies, and prepare the data for predictive modeling.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, renaming columns, and dropping unnecessary data.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Understanding sales trends, demand forecasting, and competitor pricing.
- **Visualization**: Using **Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly** for interactive visualizations.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalies in inventory levels and sales patterns.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
